Every pilot needs a logbook to keep track of their flights, whether it be for personal interest, training, or keeping track of mechanical hours for upkeep and maintenance. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of options outside of paper logbooks and some mobile applications. Using Python3, I've developed this basic application utilizing the Tkinter Graphical User Interface (GUI) to manage log entries and output them to a comma separated value (CSV) sheet.

## Usage

### Installation
Installing is as simple as clicking this [link](https://github.com/dievus/Paramotor-Pilot-Logbook/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the "Paramotor-Pilot-Logbook-main.zip" file. Once downloaded, unzip the file, open the directory, and double-click the "Paramotor-Pilot-Logbook.exe" file to open. 

You may find that Windows SmartScreen suggests not opening the file. This is because the file does not have a valid certificate chain. These are typically cost-prohibitive, and in order to provide this for free, the application is signed using a "self-signed" certificate.
